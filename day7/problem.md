# Array Transformation without Map

[LeetCode problem: Array Transformation](https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-transform-over-each-element-in-array/description/).

## Problem Description

Given an integer array arr and a mapping function fn, return a new array with a transformation applied to each element.
The returned array should be created such that returnedArray[i] = fn(arr[i], i).
The challenge is to implement this without using the built-in Array.map() method.

## What I Learned

### Array Fundamentals:

- Deepened understanding of array iteration without built-in methods
- Practice with array manipulation using traditional for loops


### Higher-Order Functions:

- Better grasp of how functions can be passed as parameters
- Understanding how callback functions work with indices


### Performance Considerations:

- Traditional loops can sometimes be more performant than built-in methods
- Memory efficiency in array operations


### Function Concepts:

- Function parameters and their usage
- Working with function references
- Function scope and closure concepts

## Real-World Applications

### Data Processing Pipelines:

- Processing large datasets with custom transformations
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations in data engineering


### UI Component Libraries:

- Transforming data before rendering in React/Vue components
- Custom state management transformations


### API Response Handling:

- Transforming API responses to match application needs
- Data normalization in frontend applications


### Image Processing:

- Applying filters or transformations to pixel arrays
- Batch processing of image data


### Financial Calculations:

- Transforming arrays of financial data
- Applying mathematical formulas to datasets

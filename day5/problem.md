# Function Composition Implementation

[LeetCode problem: Function Composition](https://leetcode.com/problems/function-composition/description/).

## Problem Description

Implement function composition that takes an array of functions and returns a new composed function. The solution should:

- Take an array of functions as input
- Return a new composed function that applies these functions in sequence
- Handle empty function arrays by returning identity function
- Process functions from right to left (last function executes first)
- Ensure each function takes one integer input and returns one integer output

## What I Learned

## Functional Programming Concepts

- Understanding function composition fundamentals
- Right-to-left evaluation sequence
- Identity function implementation
- Higher-order functions in JavaScript

## Array Manipulation

- Working with arrays of functions
- Handling edge cases (empty arrays)
- Reducing array of functions into single function

## Real-World Applications

- Data transformation pipelines
- Event handling chains
- State management in functional programming
- Building modular and reusable code

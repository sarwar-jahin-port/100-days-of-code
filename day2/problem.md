# Array Prototype Last

[LeetCode problem: Array Prototype Last](https://leetcode.com/problems/array-prototype-last/description/).

## Problem Description

Implement the `Array.prototype.last` method, which returns the last element of an array. If the array is empty, return `-1`.

## What I learned

I learned that inside Array.prototype.last, the this value refers to the array where the last method is invoked. This concept of this being context-dependent was crucial in solving the problem.
